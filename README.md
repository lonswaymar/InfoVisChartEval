## This small repository holds the contents of a project for Information Visualization, a graduate class in the INFO department at University of Colorado, Boulder.

### We were tasked with finding 3 figures IRL and improving them per the design principals outlined in "Storytelling with Data" by C. Knaflic.
### The entire Jupyter Notebook, `chart_beautify.ipynb`, can be seen in the root directory. The data, original, and updated photos are also housed in their respective folders.
